I am a PhD student in the Biomedical Engineering Program **Medical Physics** Track at UT Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), advised by Dr. [Jing Wang](https://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/115158/jing-wang.html). I work at [Medical Artificial Intelligence and Automation (MAIA) Lab](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/maia/) and [Advanced Imaging and Informatics for Radiation Therapy (AIRT) Lab](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/airt/) for my PhD thesis, my current projects mainly focus on radiomics-based cancer radiotherapy outcome prediction <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=lawzt94AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>. Before coming to UTSW, I worked with Dr. [Xuanqin Mou](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/xqmou/home) and Dr. [Xi Chen](http://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/candy/home) at the Institute of Image Processing and Pattern Recognition (IIPPR) <a href="http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/"><img class="svg" src="/images/XJTU.svg" width="23pt"></a> on Field Emission X-ray Source Array based Imaging Methods for my master's degree.

My research interest includes medical image analysis, cancer treatment outcome prediction, radiomics, and medical imaging.
